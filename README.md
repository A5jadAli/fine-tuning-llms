# Fine-tuning Large Language Models
Using state-of-the-art llms is one of the challenges due to hardware and compute issues. So, fine-tuning is one of it's solutions. I will be uploading notebooks of fine-tuned models and mostly will follow peft methods as it is one of the best fine-tuning approach. If you find any issue in the notebooks you can post it in the discussions section and I will reply there asap.
So, stay tuned and keep learning.
