# Fine-tuning Large Language Models
Using state-of-the-art LLMs is one of the challenges due to hardware and computing issues. So, fine-tuning is one of its solutions. I will be uploading notebooks of fine-tuned models and will mostly follow PEFT methods as it is one of the best fine-tuning approaches. If you find any issue in the notebooks, post it in the `discussions` section, and I will reply there ASAP.
Clone this repo in your local system using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/A5jadAli/fine-tuning-llms.git
```

So, stay tuned and keep learning.
